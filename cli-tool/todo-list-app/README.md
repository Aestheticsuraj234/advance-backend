# Simple Todo List Application

A clean and responsive Todo List application built purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete todo items, with all data persistently stored in the browser's local storage.

## Features

-   **Add Todos**: Easily add new tasks using the input field and "Add Todo" button, or by pressing Enter.
-   **Mark as Complete**: Toggle the completion status of a todo item using a checkbox. Completed items are visually distinguished.
-   **Delete Todos**: Remove tasks from the list with a dedicated delete button. Includes a confirmation prompt.
-   **Persistence**: All todo items are saved to and loaded from the browser's `localStorage`, so your tasks remain even after closing the browser.
-   **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes, providing a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
-   **Clean UI**: Modern and intuitive user interface using basic CSS styling.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5**: For the structure of the application.
-   **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For all application logic, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage management.
